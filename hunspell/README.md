# hunspell

This folder contains source code of hunspell 1.6.1 with chromium's bdict patches (https://github.com/kwonoj/hunspell/tree/feat-bdict-1.6.1) and script / configuration to build wasm target build using it.

Check dockerfile for base build configurations, and check [circleci config](https://github.com/kwonoj/hunspell-bdict-wasm/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) for build commands.
